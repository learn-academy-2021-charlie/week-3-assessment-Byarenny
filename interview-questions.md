# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `this` is used when refering to a particular key:value pair in an object. For example, to refer to a key:value pair in an object, you will need to call on it by using `this` like so; "this.state.colors" , "this.state.newColor". 

  Researched answer: A keyword that refers to the object it belongs to. Can be used in methods, classes, and functions. 



2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn allows us to store and test our code. I believe the files that are motified when you run yarn are the node.module files that are found in a react application.

  Researched answer: yarn is a package manager for your code. Yarn generates a "yarn.lock" file that helps with merging. Yarn installs and stores dependencies locally and fetches them with a "yarn add" command



3. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props in React allow us to pass down properties from the parent class to a child class. For example, if we have a parent class with a "this.carColor = red" once we pass props in a new child class, the "this.carColor = red" will get passed automatically.

  Researched answer: props pass data and methods between components in one direction from a parent to child class. Props are "read-only" and the parent property cannot be changed if the child class is changed. 



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX allows us to write javascript and HTML code in react.

  Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to Javascript. It allows HTML elements to be written in Javascript. JSK is used when writing code in react. All of your JSX code needs to be wrapped in an empty react fragment because in react, the component only renders one JSX element. 



5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM stands for "Document Object Model". I can't recall in this moment what exactly a DOM event is, I am happy to look that up and get back to you on that. 

  Researched answer: DOM events allow javascript to register event handlers on elements in an HTML document.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: the ability to render different elements or components based on a condition

2. Ruby: interpreted, high-level programming language 

3. Object oriented programming: a programm that relies on classes and objects. It structures a software program into simple and reusable pieces of code blueprints that are used to create individual instances of objects

4. Ruby hash: a container of data stored in key:value pairs 

5. Ruby blocks: anonymous functions that can be passed to a method. Blocks are enclosed in a do/end statement or curly braces{}.
